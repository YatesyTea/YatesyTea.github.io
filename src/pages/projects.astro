        A simple httpserver written in Hono and Bun, with a readonly SQLite
        instance wrapped in the application.

        It was made for my partner Stuti as she was away and I wanted to give
        her something as a nice little daily update. A requirement was that it
        should be able to load in locations with poor internet, therefore I made
        it serve as minimal a payload as possible.
